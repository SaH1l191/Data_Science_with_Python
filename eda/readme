What is Normal Distribution?
A normal distribution (also called a Gaussian distribution) is a symmetric, bell-shaped probability distribution that describes how data points are spread around the mean. In a normal distribution:

Most of the data points cluster around the mean (the center of the distribution).
As you move further away from the mean, the frequency of data points decreases.
The distribution is symmetrical, meaning the left and right sides are mirror images of each other.
The mean, median, and mode are all the same and lie at the center of the distribution.
The standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Any normal distribution can be converted into a standard normal distribution using Z-scores.

Z-scores and Outliers
A Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It helps to identify whether a data point is typical or unusual (an outlier). The formula for the Z-score is:

𝑍
=
𝑋
−
𝜇
𝜎
Z= 
σ
X−μ
​
 
Where:

𝑋
X is the data point,
𝜇
μ is the mean of the dataset,
𝜎
σ is the standard deviation.
Connection Between Z-scores and Outliers
Z > 3 or Z < -3: Data points with a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3 are considered outliers. This means that these points are more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean. In a normal distribution, about 99.7% of data points should fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean (i.e., between Z = -3 and Z = 3). Any data point outside this range is rare and can be considered an outlier.

Z > 3 means the data point is 3 standard deviations above the mean.
Z < -3 means the data point is 3 standard deviations below the mean.
Why Use Z-scores to Identify Outliers?
In a normal distribution:

68% of the data is within 1 standard deviation from the mean (Z between -1 and 1).
95% is within 2 standard deviations (Z between -2 and 2).
99.7% is within 3 standard deviations (Z between -3 and 3).
Data points that fall outside of this range are rare and may be considered anomalies or outliers because they are far from where most of the data is concentrated.

Example:
If a student's exam score has a Z-score of 3.5, it means their score is 3.5 standard deviations higher than the average exam score, which could make it an outlier (depending on the context).
If a Z-score is less than -3, the data point could be considered an outlier on the low end of the distribution.
In summary:

Normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve where most data points are around the mean.
Outliers are data points that have Z-scores above 3 or below -3, meaning they are far from the average in terms of standard deviations.

The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution. It is a normal distribution that has two key characteristics:

Mean (μ) = 0: The average or central value of the distribution is 0.
Standard deviation (σ) = 1: The spread of the data is defined by a standard deviation of 1, meaning the data points are clustered around the mean in a relatively narrow range.
Key Features of Standard Normal Distribution:
The shape of the distribution is still bell-shaped and symmetrical, just like any normal distribution.
The area under the curve is still 1, representing 100% of the possible outcomes.
It is centered at 0, meaning that half of the data points lie above 0 and half lie below 0.
The spread of the distribution is determined by the standard deviation, which in the case of the standard normal distribution is 1.
Why "Standard" Normal Distribution?
The term "standard" is used because this version of the normal distribution provides a standardized way to compare different normal distributions, no matter what their original mean and standard deviation were.

Any normal distribution, no matter its mean or standard deviation, can be converted into a standard normal distribution by converting each data point into a Z-score.

Converting a Normal Distribution to Standard Normal Distribution
You can convert a normal distribution (with mean 
𝜇
μ and standard deviation 
𝜎
σ) into a standard normal distribution using the Z-score formula:

𝑍
=
𝑋
−
𝜇
𝜎
Z= 
σ
X−μ
​
 
Where:

𝑋
X is a data point,
𝜇
μ is the mean of the original normal distribution,
𝜎
σ is the standard deviation of the original normal distribution.
Example:
Let's say you have a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.

To convert a data point 
𝑋
=
70
X=70 to the standard normal distribution:

𝑍
=
70
−
50
10
=
2
Z= 
10
70−50
​
 =2
A Z-score of 2 means that the data point is 2 standard deviations above the mean of the original normal distribution.

By converting all data points this way, you transform the original normal distribution into a standard normal distribution, where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.

Why is the Standard Normal Distribution Important?
The standard normal distribution provides a way to standardize different data sets and compare them on the same scale, regardless of their original mean or standard deviation. This allows for easier interpretation and comparison across different datasets.

You can then use Z-tables (or normal distribution tables) to find probabilities associated with specific Z-scores, which is very useful in statistics for hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and other analyses.
