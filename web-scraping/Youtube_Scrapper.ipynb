Start the challenge now: https://gfgcdn.com/tu/U4a/ Resources:- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R... Which Programming Language Should You Choose in 2025?\\nWith new frameworks and technologies springing up every year, deciding on a programming language might feel overwhelming. However, 2025 brings a few front-runners to the spotlight:\\n\\nPython remains top-tier for AI, data science, web development, and its vast ecosystem of libraries.\\nJavaScript/TypeScript drive the modern web forward, powering dynamic front-ends and robust back-ends (Node.js).\\n\\nGo (Golang) gains traction for its concurrency features, scalability, and simplicity in building microservices and cloud applications.\\n\\nJava continues to be a reliable workhorse in enterprise, Android app development, and large-scale systems.\\n\\nKotlin is a strong choice for Android development and is recognized by Google as the go-to for mobile apps. 0:00 Start 1:03 Web Dev 2:39 Game Dev 3:35 AI And ML 4:23 App Dev 5:15 Embedded System 5:50 Blockchain 6:26 DevOps\\n\\nUltimately, picking the right language depends on your target industry, the community support you need, and your personal interest. If you’re aiming for AI or data science, learning Python might boost your opportunities. Interested in high-speed or low-level applications? Rust or Go could be the future.
